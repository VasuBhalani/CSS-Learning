- max priority :- inline css 

- Inline CSS > Internal CSS > External CSS (with !important being the ultimate override).

- same jo id selector has more specificity than tag selector example like #btn:hover (inside a) has more priority than a:hover
  so there is no effect of a:hover if we apply #btn:hover
